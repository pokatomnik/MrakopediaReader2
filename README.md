# Mrakopedia Reader v2

The good old [Mrakopedia Reader](https://github.com/pokatomnik/mrakopedia-reader) is archived right now, because Its API is inaccessible.
Its API is inaccessible because It is disabled on the Mrakopedia side.
Good news, I have another one:)
This version works offline, so you can read stories without active internet connection.

Please note, you must prepare the index using [this](https://github.com/pokatomnik/mrakopedia-indexer) tool before building this app.
It takes about 4-5 hours to dump all content from the Mrakopedia website.
